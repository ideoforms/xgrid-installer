Xgrid Agent Installer for Mountain Lion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel Jones <http://www.erase.net>, November 2013

This collection of scripts installs the Xgrid Agent and Controller components on
OS X Mountain Lion. Though Xgrid was formally retired by Apple after 10.7, it still
operates successfully on 10.8.

AGENT INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Xgrid on agent machines, it is recommended that you build a custom
package file which will automatically configure the agent to use a specific
controller, with password authentication.

  1. Change to the agent directory, and run:

         ./build.sh

     You will be prompted for a controller hostname and password.
     A .pkg file will now be created corresponding to your controller setup.

  2. Transfer the resulting .pkg to an agent machine, and open it.
     This can be done via Finder, or by running:

         installer -pkg "$PKG_FILE" -target /

Alternatively, you can install the bundled .pkg file on an agent machine and
configure it manually to point at your desired Xgrid controller. 

After installing the framework

  1. In /Library/Preferences/com.apple.xgrid.agent.plist
     set ControllerName to your desired controller address.

  2. Set the controller password by running

         ./xgrid-encode-password.py > /etc/xgrid/agent/controller-password

  3. Restart the Xgrid agent:

         sudo xgridctl agent restart

CONTROLLER INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing the Xgrid controller is similar to agent installation. It is 
recommended that you build a custom package file:

  1. Change to the controller directory, and run:

         ./build.sh

     You will be prompted for a controller password.
     A .pkg file will now be created corresponding to this controller setup.

  2. Transfer the resulting .pkg to the desired controller machine, and open it.
     This can be done via Finder, or by running:

         installer -pkg "$PKG_FILE" -target /

Thanks to Eric Pardee for his invaluable Xgrid installation recipe, on which
this method is based.

Thanks to T Elliott for revealing the method of encoding that Apple use for
their Xgrid passwords.
